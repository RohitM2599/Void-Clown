# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Transition & Lab Portfolio

### 👤 Profile & Objective
**Career Transitioner:** Math Educator ➡️ Cybersecurity Analyst.
I am looking to transition to the field which embraces the analytical skills i have acquired while mentoring students.

**Current Status:** Building and securing virtualized environments while completing the CompTIA A+ curriculum.

## 🏗️ Home Lab Environment
To bridge the gap between theory and practice, I have built a dedicated security lab to simulate real-world attacks and defenses.

* **Hypervisor:** VirtualBox 
* **Attacker Node:** Kali Linux (Suite of penetration testing tools)
* **Victim Node:** Windows 10 (Target for hardening and vulnerability testing)
* **Network Analysis:** **Wireshark** (Deep packet inspection and traffic analysis)
* **Network Simulation:** **Cisco Packet Tracer** (Logical network topology and routing)

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap & Sources
I follow a "Theory + Practice" loop to ensure deep understanding.

1. **Fundamental Theory:** [Professor Messer's CompTIA A+](https://www.professormesser.com/)
2. **Guided Labs:** [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) (Current Path: Pre-Security)
3. **Simulation & Hardening:** Hands-on testing using my VirtualBox lab and Cisco Packet Tracer.
4. **Curriculum Guide:** [Roadmap.sh (Cybersecurity)](https://roadmap.sh/cyber-security)
